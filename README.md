# Agentic-AI-Conference Notes & Experiments
This repo documents my notes, learnings, practical experiments and demos on the **Agentic AI Conference (2025)** hosted by Raja Iqbal (Data Science Dojo, Ejento AI), and I will be learning directly from engineers, founders, and researchers at: AWS, Google DeepMind, Weaviate, Pinecone, Reka AI, LandingAI, Neo4j,  Docker, Haystack, Arize AI, Together AI, Serrano Academy, CrewAI, Ejento AI, Wand Ai  and many more

This forms part of my **18-week DevOps + Agentic AI Journey**, where I combine cloud engineering with multi-agent system design.

## 🔑 Why This Repo?
Agentic AI is at the cutting edge of **enterprise AI adoption**. This repo serves as:
- A **knowledge base** for myself and the community  
- A **bridge** between DevOps workflows and AgenticOps  
- A **public proof-of-learning** in my 18-week challenge
